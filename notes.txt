# read in a config with all rss feeds
#
# wget the xml files and pipe them to rss2json, parsing the json in and saving
# the parts in ~/.cache/frdr/{channel}/{item_guid}
# adding a "read: 0" field to each of the items
# if the guid does not exist or the hash of the item json is different
# than what we already have (new posts or change) => force "read: 0"
#
# pipe each of the json files into our jq program that can format the json for
# fzf:
# - list of all items in chronological order
# - list items that are "read: 0"
# - controls for marking as read, opening (and marking as read), showing "read: 1" posts
# - formatting for previewing (displaying the item's contents in a pager)
# - (perf) limit the number of posts in preview? controls to load more?
